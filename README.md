## H2 CONSOLE

In order to see data saved into the H2 database, please go to the following URL:

http://localhost:8080/h2-console/

And use the following connection parameters:

        url: jdbc:h2:mem:ontopchallengedb
        username: sa
        password: sa

## EXAMPLE DATA

The data related to bank accounts must be reusable to carry out transactions. This means that they should not be entered every time a money transfer is to be made, which is why these data are kept in a database (H2). This information is stored in the WALLETS table.
There is also a table called ACCOUNTS which stores the ONTOP banking information.

ACCOUNTS TABLE

| ID | ACCOUNT NUMBER | NAME      | ROUTING NUMBER |
|----|----------------|-----------|----------------|
| 1  | 0245253419     | ONTOP INC | 028444018      |

WALLETS TABLE

| ID | ACCOUNT NUMBER | BANK NAME | NAME  | LASTNAME | NATIONAL ID NUMBER | ROUTING NUMBER |
|----|----------------|-----------|-------|----------|--------------------|----------------|
| 1  | 1885226711     | BANK1     | TONY  | STARK    | 1111111111         | 211927207      |
| 2  |                | BANK1     | TONY  | STARK    | 1111111111         | 211927207      |
| 3  | 1885226711     | BANK1     | JAMES | FAILED   | 1111111112         | 211927207      |
| 4  | 1885226711     | BANK1     | JAMES | TIMEOUT  | 1111111113         | 211927207      |

This information is loaded by default when you start the application and corresponds to the same information that is used on the Mock server for payments.

For example, if you use accountId=1 (ONTOP) and walletId=1 (TONY STARK) to run the payment endpoint, you will get a 200 (success) response. But if you use accountId=1 and walletId=2, you will get 400 error (as in mock delivered by ontop)
The following table shows the different combinations and responses regarding the ACCOUNTS table and the WALLETS table to use with the payments endpoint.

| ACCOUNT ID | WALLET ID | RESPONSE                  |
|------------|-----------|---------------------------|
| 1          | 1         | 200 OK                    |
| 1          | 2         | 400 ERROR (body invalid)  |
| 1          | 3         | 500 ERROR (bank rejected) |
| 1          | 4         | 500 ERROR (Timeout)       |

You can use the following POSTMAN Collection to test the data [ONTOP_Challenge.postman_collection.json](./ONTOP_Challenge.postman_collection.json), also you can use the well documented [SWAGGER_UI](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html?configUrl=/v3/api-docs/swagger-config#/) to do your tests.

Keep in mind that the H2 database is configured on-memory so its data will be lost every time the application is stopped. When starting it will reload the default data

When a transaction is successful (code 200), there is data that is entered into the TRANSACTIONS and ONTOPCOMMISSIONS tables. If you want to verify the existence of this data, you must enter the [H2 console](http://localhost:8080/h2-console/) with the instructions given previously.
